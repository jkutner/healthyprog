Programmers are a lucky bunch. We get paid well to be creative, innovative and logical.  But the task of programming requires intense concentration that often causes us to neglect other aspects of our lives &mdash; namely our health.

I've met people with so much back pain that they can't work.  I've also met people who've injured their wrists by improperly using a keyboard and mouse. Even worse, I've met people whose life is in danger because they've allowed the demands of their job to interfere with their diet and physical activity levels.
<br/><br/>
All of these problems are avoidable, treatable and reversible. In fact, very small interventions can have profound effects on improving pain, reducing your risk of developing many diseases, and ultimately extending your life expectancy.

Over the course of my career I've learned how to keep myself healthy, but I made plenty of mistakes along the way:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I assumed that sitting all day was okay if I exercised in the morning.</li>
	<li>I assumed that because I was young I could eat whatever I wanted.</li>
	<li>I assumed that an achy back was just part of the job.</li>
	<li>I assumed that being lean meant I was healthy.</li>
</ul>

It's time to stop assuming.  In this book I've amassed a ton of research.  Every tip, trick and best practice is backed up not only with my own experience but also the science that tells us its acurate.
