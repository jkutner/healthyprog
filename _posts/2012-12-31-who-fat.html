This week, Drew Brees became the first NFL quarterback to throw for more than 5000 yards in three consecutive seasons -- but I'm not cheering for him.
<br/><br/>
Drew Brees is the co-chair of the <a href="http://www.fitness.gov/">President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition</a> (PCFSN) -- an organization that encourages healthy lifestyles for children. Its mission is to promote good nutrition, but that isn't stopping Mr. Brees from being the face of Pepsi.
<br/><br/>
Even worse, Brees appears in advertisments alongside the boy-band One Direction.  These commercials are directly targeting the same children that the PCFSN is trying to educate.  The sponsership is a clear conflict of interest for Brees.
<br/><br/>
Soft drinks, and specifically the high levels of fructose sugar they contain, have been identified by scientists and researchers as a predominate contributor to childhood obesity.
<br/><br/>
In <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1203039">one study</a>, 641 children who drank 8-ounces of sugar sweetened beverages each day for 18 months gained more than 2 pounds of additional weight and accumulated more fat than their peers in the control group who drank artificially sweetened drinks.  <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=199296">Another study</a> found that the risk of becoming obese increased 1.6 times for each sugar-sweeted drink a child consumed. Even more damning, a <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7450/1237.short">randomized controlled trial</a> published in the British Journal of Medicine found that a modest reduction in carbonated drinks led to a nearly 8% differental in obesity levels after 12 months.
<br/><br/>
The <a href="http://blogs.nejm.org/now/index.php/sugar-sweetened-beverages-and-the-obesity-crisis/2012/10/10/">science linking soft drinks to obesity goes on and on<a/>.  They've also been linked to type 2 diabetes and even cancer. But our consumption of these beverages continues to rise -- and obesity with it.
<br/><br/>
Acoording to the USADA, per-capita soft drink consumption has increased 500% in the last fifty years. In that same time, obesity has increased 100%.  More than 12.5 million kids and 78 million adults in America are now obese.
<br/><br/>
Sonia Capiro, an endocrinologist at Yale University, claims that reducing the comsumption of sugar-sweetened drinks like soda could reverse the astonishing increasing in childhood obesity. She wrote in <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/abstract/10.1056/NEJMe1209884">an editorial for the New England Journal of Medicine</a> that "the time has come to take action."
<br/><br/>
Certainly, the time has come for Drew Brees to make a decision: step down from the PCFSN, or publicly reonounce his Pepsi sponsership.
<br/><br/>
I hope that when my son is an adult he looks back at Drew Brees' Pepsi commercials the same way I look back at cigarette advertisements featuring Babe Ruth, Joe Dimaggio and Ted Williams.
