Programmers are a lucky bunch. We get paid well to be creative, innovative and logical.  But the task of programming requires intense concentration that often forces us to neglect other aspects of our lives &mdash; namely our health. Our bodies haven't evolved to accommodate a lifestyle of sitting, and there are many negative health effects that result from it.
<br/><br/>
In my career, I've met people with so much back pain that they can no longer sit at a desk.  I've also met people who've injured their wrists by improperly using a keyboard and mouse. Even worse, I've met people whose lives are in danger because they've allowed the demands of their job to interfere with their diet and physical activity levels.
<br/><br/>
All of these problems are avoidable, treatable and reversible. In fact, very small interventions can have profound effects on improving pain, reducing your risk of developing many diseases, and ultimately extending your life expectancy. But too many programmers remain complacent because they are not sure what to do. Is that set of sit-ups worthwhile? Is that walk around the block a waste of time?
<br/><br/>
Over the course of my career I've learned exactly what's needed to stay healthy. I've gain a great deal of experience, but I've also made plenty of mistakes along the way:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I assumed that sitting all day was okay if I exercised in the morning.</li>
	<li>I assumed that because I was young I could eat whatever I wanted.</li>
	<li>I assumed that an achy back was just part of the job.</li>
	<li>I assumed that if I wasn't obese then I was healthy.</li>
</ul> 

<p class="blog-post">
It's time to stop assuming.  In this book I've amassed a ton of research.  Every tip, trick and best practice is backed up not only with my own experience but also the science that tells us it works. I've consulted with doctors, therapists, nutritionists and numerous fitness experts. I've also interviewed well-known programmers, like Chad Fowler, who have their own story to tell.
<br/><br/>
I wrote this book because I want to help you improve your life. Being healthy doesn't take a big investment &mdash; in neither time nor money &mdash; but it pays huge dividends.
