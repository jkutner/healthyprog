Every time I step outside I think to myself "damn if I don't wish I had a job that required me to work outside." My body wants to move, get dirty and be used because that's what evolution has taught it to do over millions of years. Unfortunately, my job doesn't make it easy. As a programmer, I'm faced with a perpetual struggle between caring for the health of the code I write and the health of my body.  But I've never considered foregoing one for the sake of the other. 
<br/><br/>
Yesterday, Elise Worthy announced her decision to do just that &mdash; she's <a href="http://eliseworthy.com/post/43591388486/i-quit-my-job">quiting her job as a programmer</a> to focus on her health. It's a bold and brave decision, and I wish her well. But for the rest of us, who can't pry ourselves away from our computers for six months (let alone 6 minutes), there are still many things we can do to stay healthy. We can begin by answering for ourselves the questions that Elise has asked: 
<br/><br/>
<i>"Why is brain work so much more important than body work?"</i>
<br/><br/>
I think that Milton Glaser answered this question when he said "<a href="http://vimeo.com/23285699">the model for personal development is antithetical to the model for professional success</a>". In order to become the best Ruby programmer in the world (or whatever you want to be), it often feels that you must lock yourself in a closet and hack on Ruby code all day.  Too often, we forget that being our best also requires balance.  
<br/><br/>
Balance is the reason we learn new programming languages that we'll never use.  We strengthen the breadth of our professional skills in order to enhance our existing skills. In many ways, this is the same reason we must take care of our health.  By nurturing our bodies, we can actually improve the balance of our professional skills.
<br/><br/>
The last decade of science has made <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v9/n1/abs/nrn2298.html">the connection between our mind and body</a> unbelievably clear. We've learned that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12086747">exercise stimulates the production of proteins</a> that strengthen neurochemical connections in our gray matter. It also increases the brain's oxygen and glucose levels, which can improve our cognitive abilities. It even promotes the growth of new neurons and protects them against damage and stress. 
<br/><br/>
So I think Elise made one mistake: over the next six months she'll still be doing brain work. The health of our bodies is intimately coupled to the function of our brains.  Healthy living improves problem solving skills, fluid intelligence, cognitive flexibility, and memory. Ultimately, the brain cannot function at it's best without a healthy body. 
<br/><br/>
That brings us to Elise's next question:
<br/><br/>
<i>"Why am I achieving all of these goals at the expense of my health?"</i>
<br/><br/>
I understand Elise's concern. It's the same feeling I get when I step outside. However (and with all due respect), I think this is a false dichotomy. Yes, our professional goals get in the way of our personal health, but it doesn't have to be that way.  
<br/><br/>
You can make profound improvements to your health with just a few simple changes to your daily routines. The list below outlines a few things you can do as a sedentary programmer to stay healthy and take care of your own systems the way you take care of the ones you write code for. 
<br/><br/>
1. Get away from your desk for 5-minutes every hour and move your body.  Do some push-ups or walk. Studies suggest that this simple amount of movement can significantly reduce the consequences of being sedentary. 
<br/><br/>
2. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Don't undervalue the benefit of doing short spurts of moderately intense exercise throughout the day. Studies suggest that it might be more beneficial than those 30 minute trips to the gym.
<br/><br/>
3. Walk as much as you can. The next time you schedule a meeting, forego the conference room.  Take your co-workers outside and walk while you talk. The initial difference between doing nothing and walking is the more important to your health than anything else. 
<br/><br/>
4. Make one small improvement to your health every day. Maybe you avoided the office candy bowl for the first time. Or maybe you did one more push-up than ever before.  I call this a "kaizen approach to health", and it's important because changes to your health happen slowly over long periods of time (that's why we don't notice the bad changes). In order to make good change, you must focus on the little stuff. 
<br/><br/>
Elise will probably be taking a more comprehensive approach to improving her health, but she'll still be doing it one step at a time.  As she mentions in her post: quantifiable metrics, a schedule of courses, and specific goals will drive her progress. Given that, I'm sure she'll be successful. 
But the rest of us programmers need the exact same structure. Metrics, schedules and goals are critical to taking care of our health. 
<br/><br/>
I challenge you to start right now: set a goal for your health.  It can be small, like losing 10 pounds, or big, like running a marathon. Then you can start making small increment progress towards achieving.  As long as you make one small step forward each day, you won't be quitting on your health.
<br/><br/>
