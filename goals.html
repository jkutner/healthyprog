      Change One Habit
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Pick a simple habit of yours and change it. A good example might be walking to the vending machine at work to buy a candy bar every afternoon. Or maybe just switching the pocket where you put your keys. In the book, we'll discuss some strategies that will make this faster and easier.

      Buy a Pedometer
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This is probably the easiest goal in the book, but possibly one of the most useful. In fact, many studies show that simply wearing a pedometer is correlated to taking more steps.
      Below is a list of links to a few recommended pedometers you can buy:

      Enhance Your Workstation
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      The best desk position is the one you aren't in right now -- movement is key to being healthy. If your workstation doesn't allow for you to change position, then it's an obstacle. Use the advice in this chapter to enhance your workstation so that it facilitates at least three different positions.

      Count Your Calories For One Day
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This may sounds simple but there's a good chance you'll get it wrong. Studies have shown that most people are very inaccurate when counting calories.  They don't include snacks, they feel ashamed and ultimately underestimate. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      In <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/76/1/107.short">one case</a>, two neuroscientists at Kennesaw State University in Georgia had people photograph their food before they recorded it in a diary. They found that the majority of participants had substantially underestimated their food intake -- sometimes by an entire meal. <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/40/6/1327.short">Other studies</a> have found that subjects underestimated their consumption by an average of 13 percent.
