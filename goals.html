      Change One Habit
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Pick a simple habit of yours and change it. A good example might be walking to the vending machine at work to buy a candy bar every afternoon. Or maybe just switching the pocket where you put your keys. In the book, we'll discuss some strategies that will make this faster and easier.

      Buy a Pedometer
    </p>
